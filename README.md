# Dynamo Blog

Building a simple CRUD app as Blog,
for testing [Dynamo framework](https://github.com/elixir-lang/dynamo)
Built with [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).

I think is a good way to get into funcitonal programming.

We'll se where this take us.

It uses PostgreSQL as database, with [exdi_pgsql](https://github.com/exdbi/exdbi_pgsql) as adapter.

Requirements:
* Erlang R16B
* Elixir 0.9.x
* PostgreSQL 1.9.2

For running the project:

    mix server

This will start the server on http://localhost:4000
